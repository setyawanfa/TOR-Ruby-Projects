# Knight Travails

. Put together a script that creates a game board and a knight.
. Treat all possible moves the knight could make as children in a tree. Donâ€™t allow any moves to go off the board.
. Decide which search algorithm is best to use for this case. Hint: one of them could be a potentially infinite series.
. Use the chosen search algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting square (or node) and the ending square. Output what that full path looks like, e.g.:

## Solution

Board size is assumed at 8x8 size since there is no information regarding the dynamic allocated board size.
`Knight` class used to implement data structure and search function in `knight_moves` method.
